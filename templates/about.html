        <h2>About PresentSer</h2>
        <p>
            PresentSer is a simple, fast, student-friendly attendance calculator built by Fayas.
            It helps students track their attendance with zero stress — clean UI, quick results,
            and no ads.
        </p>
        </p>
           We all joke about bunking, but the real problem begins when attendance drops
  below the required percentage and we start worrying about <b>condonation</b>.
  Every semester, students stress about the same questions
         </p>
        <p>
            The idea is simple: give students a clean tool that actually helps them stay on track.
            No confusion, no clutter — just the numbers you need.
        </p>
        questions:

  <br><br>
  <b>“How many more days do I need to attend to avoid condonation?”</b><br>
  <b>“If I take leave tomorrow, will it go below the safe limit?”</b><br>
  <b>“What exactly is my current percentage right now?”</b>

  <br><br>
  Most apps online were complicated, filled with ads, or gave incorrect results.
  So I built PresentSer — a clean, fast, and distraction-free attendance tool
  that tells you exactly:

  <ul style="margin-top:6px; line-height:1.55;">
    <li>✔ How much more attendance you need to stay safe</li>
    <li>✔ Whether you’re close to getting condonation</li>
    <li>✔ How many days you can safely bunk (if any)</li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  No ads. No login. No unnecessary screens.
  Just the numbers you need to stay within college rules — without stress.

  <br><br>
  PresentSer was created because every student deserves clarity,
  not confusion, especially when attendance decides whether you write exams.
